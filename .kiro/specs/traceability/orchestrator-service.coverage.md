# cc-sdd Coverage — orchestrator-service

## Requirements Covered (planned)
- 1 (constraint models load/reload/multi-format)
- 2 (task decomposition)
- 3 (routing and health-aware selection)
- 4 (result synthesis with provenance/conflict resolution)
- 5 (confidence evaluation and human escalation)
- 6 (task context, spores, provenance)
- 7 (error handling and retries/fallback/partial results)
- 8 (async execution and task lifecycle)
- 9 (metrics across stages)
- 10 (MCP integration across all comms)

## Notes
- Coverage is prospective; implementation depends on DMF and MCP readiness (both partially available).
