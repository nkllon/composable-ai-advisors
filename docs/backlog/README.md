### Backlog Guide

- Edit `docs/backlog/BACKLOG.md` to add or reprioritize items.
- Buckets: Now / Next / Later / Icebox. Keep items short and action-oriented.
- When you decide to start work, open a GitHub issue referencing the backlog line; link the PR to the issue.
- Prefer referencing spec requirement IDs (e.g., CIW-REQ-007) where applicable.
